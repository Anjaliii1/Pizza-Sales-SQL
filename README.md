# Pizza-Sales-SQL

#### Description : In this Data Analysis project, we analyze pizza sales data to uncover trends and insights that can inform business decisions. The dataset includes key variables such as order date, customer demographics, pizza type, and sales revenue. Using SQL, we perform queries to track sales performance over time, identify popular pizza varieties, and segment customer purchasing behavior. The analysis aims to optimize marketing strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance overall sales performance, providing actionable recommendations for the pizza business.
